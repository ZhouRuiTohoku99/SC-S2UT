# SC-S2UT

Here is the usage guide for our Speaker Consistent Speech-to-Speech Translation (SC-S2UT) system, which includes the original SC-S2UT model, as well as the self-supervised pretraining and embedding methods.

Our original SC-S2UT work was published at APSIPA ASC 2024 under the title "Improving Speaker Consistency in Speech-to-Speech Translation Using Speaker Retention Unit-to-Mel Techniques". You can refer to the paper for more detailed information. 

The pretraining and embedding versions of our work are available as an arXiv preprint and are being prepared for submission to a journal.

The structure of our system is illustrated in the diagram below.
